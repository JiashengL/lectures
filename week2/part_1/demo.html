      A University of Chicago education is about 
      <strong>more than gaining a set of <span class="important">skills, achieving a rite of passage</span>,</strong>
      or even 
      <i>honing the ability to think critically</i>. 
      It is a way of experiencing and moving through the world—interest in a lifelong dialogue across cultures and disciplines, inclination to ask good questions, and willingness to change perspective after encountering new ideas. From the beginning, we’ve believed in the benefits of a liberal arts education, including a robust intellectual foundation in a diversity of disciplines.
