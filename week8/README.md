# Week 8

Today we'll finish our Movies app.


### Getting Started

You will need to have Node installed. 

Then, after cloning this repository, do this **only once:**

``` shell
week8$ cd react-movies
week8/react-movies$ npm install
```

Now, you can start (or restart) the server whenever you want:

``` shell
week8/react-movies $ npm start
```

**Press Ctrl-C to stop the server anytime.**

### Important Ideas This Week

New concepts:

* Handling forms and "controlled" input components
* React "snapshot" rendering process
* React state change queueing
* More details about JS object destructuring

Still continuing with these themes:

* Concept of "state" and circumstances where state management is complicated
* Lots of JS syntax knowledge
